# Pathfinder
Implements the A* pathfinding algorithm to find the path in a maze that is drawn by the user.

The user gets displayed a canvas. The first step for the user is to pick a start and an end point. After doing this, the user is able to draw walls. 
Finally, the shortest path is found (if available) and the length is given to the user. During the search, the intermediate steps that are taken by the algortihm are displayed.
